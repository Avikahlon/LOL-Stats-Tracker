## 🔍 Project Overview

Due to the lack of direct access to competitive League of Legends datasets, this project utilizes a custom-built scraper to extract performance metrics from trusted external sites. The data is processed through an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline and stored in a relational database, providing a clean foundation for **advanced data visualization and trend analysis in Power BI**.
